            <h1 class="text-4xl px2 py-2">How it started ?</h1>
            <p>A few days ago, as you may know, I attended MumbaiFOSS. I actually
                booked tickets for both Mumbai and Pune FOSS events because the reason
                for booking both was that whatever I learned from MumbaiFOSS, I could
                apply in PuneFOSS. I didn’t want to just be an attendee at events. It
                felt weird just to go listen, attend and get a couple of swags. I
                was already familiar with public speaking, as I had given introductory
                talks on Brain Chips in my class and in competitions. So, I had no
                reason to give a second thought to speaking at PuneFOSS. I asked some
                friends of mine and finalized my topic and wrote a CFP for PuneFOSS. I
                chose “Introduction to Minimalistic Distributions and Packaging with
                Arch Linux”. An advanced or super user might say they don’t relate much,
                but I wanted to speak about these topics for a very long time, and during my
                talk, I was going to try to create a connection.</p>
                <br />
            <p>So, finally the day came I got a call from “abcd efgh” on
                <strong>trucaller</strong>, of course, I ignored the call for a days
                thinking it of as a spammer or smth like that. But the next day my
                parents took up the call, And luckily it was <strong><a
                        href="https://twitter.com/faizan8684">faizan</a></strong>, the
                organizer. He called me regarding the CFP. So, he asked me my journey
                and what I’m going to talk and how will I prepare for it. After having a
                nice long talk for half a hour. He said “Ok, we approve you as a
                speaker, just reply to the approval email in some time”. So, I followed
                it. I was totally fired up by the time. From that day, I started
                preparing my PPT and of course started reading every possible page on the
                <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org">archwiki</a>. Soon, the days passed
                as flowing water of the river. My talk posts were released and the
                schedule too.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>I had my friend <strong>Ash</strong> who was experienced with giving
                talks from the age of 15. So, he has been of a great help to a dumb boi
                like me lmao. He spotted mistakes in ppt’s and made useful suggestions
                which I could’nt deny applying.</p>

                <br />
            <h2 class="text-4xl px2 py-2">Leaving for Pune!!</h2>
            <p>So, I’m from <strong>Solapur</strong>, takes some 5-6 hours to reach
                pune. So, 2 days before the talk I was actually preparing too much, I
                guess. I sat for some 5-6 hours continously on my chair and more before
                that. So, I felt like let’s get up and do some pushups. Ok, I did 10,
                then 15 and after that I got a <strong>cramp in my back
                </strong>😂😂.Not gonna lie, it was too painful to handle, but I wasn’t
                thinking much about it. So, the next day on Thursday, we 3 friends went
                to do some shopping (I was still feeling the pain).So, after coming home
                I did some checkin’s for FAQ’s and stuff like that. So, then my mother
                did some home remedies and for god sake my back was totally relieved.
                So, I packed my clothes, got my potato pc and all the other things in my
                bag packed. Me and my friends were to leave by 6:30 in the morning by
                train. So, we reached pune had some breakfast, and went into a room
                hunt. Unfortunately, we got none near the venue. So, we had to stay 6km
                away from the venue. That day we enjoyed as hell. We went to FC Road and
                Lakshmi Market, to just roam around on streets and have street foods.
                <strong>Coffee’s</strong> were the best parts for me
            </p>
            <br />
            <h1 class="text-4xl px2 py-2">D’day of PuneFOSS.</h1>
            <p>Slept at 3 am on Saturday. and woke up at 6:17 am. I got ready,
                packed my bag and we checked out of the hotel. We were leaving for
                <strong>Cummins Engineering College</strong>. The organizers were
                already there, and they allowed me to get in prior for setting up
                <strong>xrandr</strong>, So it won’t cause any issues later (lol).
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>My Talk was supposed to be the 2nd one after <strong>Vishal
                    Arya</strong>. But, I guess he was late due to some circumstances.
                Hence, Faizan the organizer announced my talk. So, I got up took my
                potato pc in my hand, went on to the stage, opened the ppt and greeted
                everyone. I wasn’t scared so much I was in chill and I already decided,
                “What I’m gonna speak is what I’m going to enjoy”. So, I wasn’t tensed
                at all because, I was just going to have fun right? The real fun started
                when I was talking about contriibution guidelines and I suddenly saw
                “<strong>system going down</strong>” due to low battery, because I
                forgot to plugin the charger, Gotta say mahn that was the real panic
                moment. My talk started, and I had to hurry up a bit at the Packaging
                part. So, heartfelt apologies to all the listeners. As it was my first
                talk, <strong>25 minutes</strong> flushed out like <strong>25
                    seconds</strong>. I might have messed up at moments, but I tried my
                level best. And, I was done with the talk.</p>
                <br />
            <p>During, in the Q&A. I was very happy because <a href="https://twitter.com/WishArya">Vishal Arya</a>, one
                of the guys
                whom I admired the most, wanted to ask a question. And I answered him. I
                was very glad that he appreciated my talk before he got started with
                his. it’s a very small thing, but yeah for me it all mattered. And then
                came top notch talks by my fellow speakers. The enterprenueral talk was
                just fabulous, fun, and totally perfect. Talks I enjoyed the most were
                by <strong>Leon Nunes</strong>, <strong>Harsh Mishra</strong>,
                <strong>Shloka Shah</strong>, <strong>Sangeeta Gupta</strong>,
                <strong>Khalid Khan</strong> . And all the other talks were awesome
                too.

            <h2 class="text-4xl px2 py-2">What Have I Learnt ?</h2>
            <p>I am not a professional or a good programmer at all. I am just an
                enthusiast, curious guy, or you can say “Jack of everything, Master of
                none”. One thing, I might specify is I learnt how to learn. And never
                sitting quite or just waiting for the moment. I might say, I’ve met very
                fabulous people. And would never forget them and also never forget 1
                April, 2023 ever in my life.</p>
            <h2 class="text-4xl px2 py-2">VOF</h2>
            <p>I’ve learn’t a lot from all those. Everyone was very polite and
                humble towards each other. I didn’t feel like they were considering with
                <strong>Kacha Nimbu</strong> (LMFAO). I was getting
                <strong>equally</strong> treated. Well, that’s what a FOSS event is.
                Everyone comes just to learn.
            </p>
